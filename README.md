# sonarqube-slack-pusher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andnyb/sonarqube-slack-pusher.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/andnyb/sonarqube-slack-pusher)
Jenkins plugin for pushing SonarQube projects quality gate status to a given Slack channel.

The plugin runs as a post build action and runs no matter the outcome of the job. The plugin makes an API request to
a SonarQube server instance to get the quality status for a given SonarQube project. If the SonarQube project has a quality gate defined the plugin will report to a configured Slack channel if there are any 'failed' quality gate checks.

For a failed quality gate it would look like this:
